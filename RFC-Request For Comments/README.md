# 💡 RFC Repository for [Your Project Name]

This repository hosts RFCs (Request for Comments) that propose **major or potentially disruptive changes** to the [Your Project Name] codebase, architecture, or overall direction.

It serves as a structured space for thoughtful discussion, transparent decision-making, and long-term documentation of key project evolutions.

## 📘 What Is an RFC?

An **RFC** is a design document that outlines a **new feature**, **refactor**, **architecture change**, or **policy update**. It allows contributors and maintainers to:

- Propose a **major idea** in a formalized way
- Discuss **alternatives** and tradeoffs before implementation
- Provide a long-term reference to **why** something changed

We are loosely inspired by the [IETF RFC model](https://www.rfc-editor.org/), used for web standards like HTTP, as well as the RFC processes from projects like [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs) and [Python](https://peps.python.org/).

## 🧠 When Should I Write an RFC?

Write an RFC when you are about to propose a **significant** change that affects:

- Application architecture
- Public APIs
- Dependency updates
- Migration of core libraries or paradigms
- Major behavior or performance changes
- Non-trivial refactors that impact multiple modules
- Workflow/tooling decisions that affect all contributors

> ⚠️ For small bug fixes or local refactors, **open a pull request directly** in the main codebase repo instead.

## ✍️ RFC Lifecycle

Here's the flow for proposing an RFC:

1. **Create a new folder**:  
   Use the next available RFC number, e.g. `RFC-005-meaningful-name`
2. **Add your RFC** as a `README.md` inside the folder.  
   Follow the [RFC Template](./rfc-template.md).
3. **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of this repo
   - Title format: `RFC-005: Meaningful Title`
4. **Review & Discussion** will take place in the PR
   - Anyone can comment
   - Major stakeholders are expected to weigh in
5. **Approval**: Once accepted, the PR is merged.
6. The RFC is considered **"Accepted"** and can now be implemented in the project.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

Each RFC lives in its own folder:
```
RFC-000-meaningful-title/
│
├── README.md # The actual RFC content
```

RFCs are numbered sequentially and never deleted—even if later superseded or rejected.

---

## 🧪 Status Labels

PRs will be labeled based on review stage:

- `proposed` – Open for discussion
- `accepted` – Approved, pending or in implementation
- `rejected` – Closed after review
- `withdrawn` – Author has voluntarily pulled back the RFC
- `superseded` – Replaced by a newer RFC

---

## 📋 Why Use RFCs?

- ✨ Encourage well-thought-out contributions  
- 💬 Promote open, async, written discussions  
- 📚 Provide a historical record of **why** and **how** the project evolved  
- 🔍 Avoid ad-hoc decisions and implementation surprises

## 🙌 Contributing

We welcome proposals from all contributors. Whether you're a core developer or a first-time contributor with a big idea—RFCs are your voice in shaping the future of the project.
